# Classification-using-KNN
This project demonstrates gender classification using the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm. The k-NN algorithm is a simple and effective classification technique used in machine learning. In this project, we use k-NN to predict the gender of individuals based on certain features.

Gender classification is a fundamental problem in machine learning and natural language processing. The objective of this project is to build a gender classification model using the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. The k-NN algorithm works by finding the k-nearest data points to a given query point and using their labels to classify the query point.
